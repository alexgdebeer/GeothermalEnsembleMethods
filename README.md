# Geothermal Ensemble Methods

This repository contains code for running ensemble Kalman methods for approximate Bayesian inference on a set of simple geothermal models.

## TODO:
### Slice
 - Check whether things are still working for this model after the repository refactor.
### Channel
 - Add feedzone locations.
 - Figure out what the mean upflow should be, and the marginal standard deviations.
 - Finish writing setup code and test model.
 - Set up mechanism to save true parameters, states and data to file.
### Ensemble Methods
 - Tidy up EKI-DMC and EnRML code (less object-oriented?)
### Misc
 - Update NZGW code and slides.
 - Finish writing README (add some notes on the various algorithms, other implementations, etc).
