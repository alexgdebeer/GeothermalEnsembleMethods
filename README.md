# Geothermal Ensemble Methods

This repository contains code for running ensemble Kalman methods for approximate Bayesian inference on a set of simple geothermal models.

## TODO:
### Channel
 - Finish writing setup code and test model.
### Ensemble Methods
 - Tidy up EKI-DMC and EnRML code (less object-oriented?)
### Misc
 - Update NZGW code and slides.
 - Finish writing README (add some notes on the various algorithms, other implementations, etc).
